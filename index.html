        <p class="section-text">
	  What’s spiky, puffy, and one of the most poisonous creatures in the world? Why, the pufferfish of course! Pufferfish are very interesting creatures, so let’s dive in!  Pufferfish are a type of vertebrate, which means they have a backbone. There are five main vertebrate groups, mammals, birds, amphibians, and fish. Like all fish, pufferfish have gills, lay eggs, and are cold blooded. So now you know why they are considered fish, but you still need to know much, much more.

      <h2 class="heading">Habitat</h2>
      <p class="section-text">
        You must now be wondering, “Where do pufferfish live?” We will answer that question right here and now.  According to the website National Geographic Kids, adult pufferfish are pelagic. That means that they live in open water. However, juveniles, or children, live closer to shore. Additionally, according to National Geographic Kids, pufferfish tend to live in tropical or subtropical waters, and according to “Facts About the Pufferfish'' by Lisa Strattin, they also live near coral reefs and rocks. Now your question has been answered, but stay here, for we are still in juvenile pufferfish territory.

        <h2 class="heading">Predators and Prey</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
          Are you still hungry for knowledge? Let’s find out what eats pufferfish, and what they eat! You’d think pufferfish wouldn’t and couldn’t be eaten, but surprisingly they are preyed on by tiger sharks and sea snakes. According to “Pufferfish” by Therese M. Shea, this is because the pufferfish’s poison, tetradotoxin, does not harm those predators. 
          According to “Facts About the Pufferfish” by Lisa Strattin, Pufferfish are omnivores. Smaller pufferfish eat algae and plankton. Additionally, according to “Pufferfish”, “larger pufferfish eat worms, shrimp, lobsters, sea stars, crabs, and clams.” Pufferfish are ambush predators, which means they sneak up on their prey. Unfortunately, according to the website AZ animals, pufferfish are sometimes eaten and kept as pets by people. Because of this, some pufferfish species are at the near threatened status. However, most pufferfish are at the least concern status, at least in the sense of being endangered. So now you know their predators and prey, but I bet you’re still hungry, so let’s keep learning!

      <h2 class="heading">Physical Description</h2>
      <p class="section-text">
        So by now you know many things about the pufferfish, but not what it looks like! So let’s take a peek and find out more! One of the pufferfish’s most well known features is its toxic spikes. Another defining feature is it’s ability to inflate, or puff up. “How do they do this?” you might ask. Well according to the website Smithsonian Ocean, “They can inflate their body several times its ordinary size by rapidly pumping air or water into their stomach.” The pufferfish’s size can range from one inch to two feet, according to AZ Animals. That’s about the size of a three stud long lego brick to the size of a french roll! They can weigh anywhere from a few ounces to 30 lbs, according to the website National Geographic. That’s about the weight of an apple to the weight of a bag of potting soil. That’s heavy! So now you know what they look like, but you still need to know about their babies. Keep reading to keep learning!

    <h2 class="heading">Babies</h2>
    <p class="section-text">
      We’ve gone over many things, but I bet you’re wondering, “What about the babies?” Well let’s answer that question and learn about them. The female pufferfish will lay her eggs on the shore, and the eggs will float on the water for about one week. Then, the pufferfish eggs hatch. According to “Pufferfish,” “a baby pufferfish, called a fry, keeps its eggshell until its tail, fins and other body parts are finished growing a few days later.” Then, the eggshell falls off. Baby pufferfish actually look a lot like their parents (see physical description for more detail on the adults’ looks). I bet you still want to learn just a little bit more, so stay tuned for some fun facts, or possibly scary facts.

<h2 class="heading">Conclusion</h2>
<p class="section-text">
  In the last page I promised some fun facts, so here they are! First of all, the dwarf, or pygmy, pufferfish is only found in one river in India! Another fact is that according to “Facts About the Pufferfish” they are the second most poisonous animal in the world, after the golden poison dart frog. Finally, some people actually eat pufferfish! According to Smithsonian Ocean, pufferfish in the genus takifugu are often served in Japan. Furthermore, according to “Pufferfish,” “it takes more than a year to learn how to cook this fish in a way that makes it safe.” Unfortunately, about five people die from it every year. Pufferfish are very interesting creatures, and I hope you liked learning all about them.

    <h2 class="heading">Would You Rather</h2>
    <p class="section-text">
      I would rather see a pufferfish in an aquarium instead of in the wild. “Why?” you might ask. Well here are some reasons why. For starters, I would not want to get poked. I mean, one, it would hurt, and two, I might die afterward. Another reason why I would want to see it in an aquarium is because the workers there would take good care of the pufferfish. It would not get eaten, and it could get lots of food. The last reason is because many more people could enjoy seeing it. Hopefully the pufferfish is an extrovert!
