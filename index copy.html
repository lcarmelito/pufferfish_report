	  What’s spiky, puffy, and one of the most poisonous creatures in the world? Why, the pufferfish of course! Pufferfish are very interesting creatures, so let’s dive in!  Pufferfish are a type of vertebrate, which means they have a backbone. There are five main vertebrate groups, mammals, birds, amphibians, and fish. Like all fish, pufferfish have gills, lay eggs, and are cold blooded. So now you know why they are considered fish, but you still need to know much, much more.

        You must now be wondering, “Where do pufferfish live?” We will answer that question right here and now.  According to the website National Geographic Kids, adult pufferfish are pelagic. That means that they live in open water. However, juveniles, or children, live closer to shore. Additionally, according to National Geographic Kids, pufferfish tend to live in tropical or subtropical waters, and according to “Facts About the Pufferfish'' by Lisa Strattin, they also live near coral reefs and rocks. Now your question has been answered, but stay here, for we are still in juvenile pufferfish territory.

          Are you still hungry for knowledge? Let’s find out what eats pufferfish, and what they eat! You’d think pufferfish wouldn’t and couldn’t be eaten, but surprisingly they are preyed on by tiger sharks and sea snakes. According to “Pufferfish” by Therese M. Shea, this is because the pufferfish’s poison, tetradotoxin, does not harm those predators. 	
According to “Facts About the Pufferfish” by Lisa Strattin, Pufferfish are omnivores. Smaller pufferfish eat algae and plankton. Additionally, according to “Pufferfish”, “larger pufferfish eat worms, shrimp, lobsters, sea stars, crabs, and clams.” Pufferfish are ambush predators, which means they sneak up on their prey. Unfortunately, according to the website AZ animals, pufferfish are sometimes eaten and kept as pets by people. Because of this, some pufferfish species are at the near threatened status. However, most pufferfish are at the least concern status, at least in the sense of being endangered. So now you know their predators and prey, but I bet you’re still hungry, so let’s keep learning!
